Install any text editor of your choice <br/>
I personally use Microsoft VS Code <br/>
Download the latest version of VS Code <br/>
It has inbuilt support for typescript language <br/>
You will have to install Typescript compiler separately <br/>
If you are in a Node environment, you can run "npm install tsc" on your terminal. This will install the Typescript compiler for you.

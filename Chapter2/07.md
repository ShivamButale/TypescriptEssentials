This video discusses the concept of destructuring.<br/>
It gives the ability to assign values to multiple variables from a single object with a single statement. <br/>
For simplicity, it can be considered to the opposite of creating a bunch of variables and combining them into an array. <br/>

For e.g. <br/>
const arr = [1,2,3];<br/>
const [a, b, c] = [arr];<br/>
This single statement assigns the values 1,2,3 to variables a,b,c respectively.<br/>

const a = 1;<br/>
const b = 2;<br/>
[a,b] = [b, a];<br/>

const obj = {<br/>
&emsp a: 1, <br/>
&emsp b: 2, <br/>
 &emsp c: 3<br/>
};<br/>
const {a, b, c} = obj; <br/>
This creates a new object whose properties a, b, c will be picked up from 'obj';<br/>

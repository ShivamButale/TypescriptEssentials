This video discusses the feature - Template Strings <br/>
This is syntactic sugar<br/>
This allows us to use variable values directly in srings in an easy-to-use syntax and understandable way <br/>

e.g. <br/>
We want to log: There are 10 apples. Here the value 10 is present in a variable and will be picked up at the time of logging  <br/>
const a = 10;  <br/>
console.log(`There are ${a} apples.`); <br/>
instead of console.log('There are '+a+' apples'); <br/>

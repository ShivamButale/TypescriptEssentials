This video discusses the concept of <strong>controlling visibility with access modifiers</strong>.<br>
We can declare class properties/members as private.<br>
This means they will be accessible only inside the class. <br>
Example: <br>
<pre>
<code>
class abc {
    private state: string;
}

class xyz extends abc {
    private state2: string;
}
</code>
</pre>
Here since state is declared private, it would not be accessible in class xyz.

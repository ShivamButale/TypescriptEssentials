This video discusses the concept of <strong>inheriting behavior from a base class</strong>. <br>
<pre>
<code>
class abc {
    private state: string;
}

class xyz extends abc {
    private state2: string;
}

Now class xyz has 2 properties state and state2. It has inherited property state from base class abc.

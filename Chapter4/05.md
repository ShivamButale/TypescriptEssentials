This video discusses the concept of <strong>defining anonymous types</strong>.<br>
We can declare a variable with a type which we can define on the fly.<br>

Here is an example:<br>
<pre>
<code>
let todo: { name: string};
Here todo is an object with property name of type string.

todo = {
    name: 'Todo1',
};
</code>
</pre>

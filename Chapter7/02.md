This video discusses the concept of organizing code with namespaces.<br>
Example: <br>

<pre>
<code>
namespace Model {
    export enum State{
        New=1,
        Active,
        Completed,
        Deleted
    }
}

State should now be accessed as Model.State

It is also possible to declare same namespace twice.
namespace Model {
    export enum NewState {
       abc=1,
       xyz
    }
}

NewState should now be accessed as Model.NewState
</code>
</pre>

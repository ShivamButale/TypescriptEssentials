This video discusses the concept of type inference.
It means typescript infers the data types of variables, return types, etc.

Example:
If you declare this function :
function abc(a: string, b: string) {
    return a+b;
}

Now if you hover over the function abc, you will see typescript shows its return type as string.
So, typescript has inferred the return type of this function.
